if you were to
    remove the form tags
        the button would not work
            and the page would not refresh

if you were to change
    the type attribute value to button 
        and not submit
            the page would not refresh

if you were to type nothing but spaces
    in both the password and username
        it would still validate
            to kill the white space
                we us the .trim() method on value
                    which is a JavaScript String Method

you could us required 
    at the end of the html input tags
        but it would still allow white space
            which is a blank value

video 2 
    we are going to require 
        a certain length

we could use the or opporators
    shown here:

if(username.value.trim() == "" ||password.value.trim() == ""){
    alert("No blank values allowed");
    return false
}else {
    true;

            but then we couldn't see
                which input had the error
                    and we couldn't make
                        particular messages 
                            for each indescresion

now we are going to add
    a red border around the invalid entry
        using css
